1. Kakurasu

it's generally not possible for a computer to solve Kakurasu in O(n^2) time complexity using DFS or any other known algorithm. Here's why:

Inherent Complexity of Kakurasu: Kakurasu is a decision problem, meaning the goal is to find a solution that satisfies the given constraints (row sums and column values). Unfortunately, decision problems like Kakurasu are well-known to be inherently complex in the worst case.
NP-Completeness: Kakurasu is suspected to be NP-Complete, a class of problems where verifying a solution is solvable in polynomial time (O(n^k) for some constant k), but finding the solution itself is likely intractable. This means there's no known efficient algorithm (polynomial time) to solve all Kakurasu instances guaranteed, including arbitrarily large grids with specific clue configurations that might lead the DFS to explore a vast number of possibilities.

While DFS can be a practical solution for many Kakurasu puzzles due to early pruning of invalid paths
